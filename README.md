## How to Play

### Introduction :
Chess is a game of strategy and reflection that pits two players against each other on a board of 64 squares, alternately light and dark, called a chessboard. Each player controls an army of 16 pieces, including a king, queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means that the king is threatened with capture and cannot escape this threat.

At the start of the game, the pieces are placed in the two rows closest to each player.The arrangement is symmetrical with respect to the median axis of the chessboard.Pawns occupy each player's second row, while the other pieces occupy the first row in the order: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight and rook.
Piece movement :
"pawn " move forward one square at a time, but may move forward two squares on their first move.They capture diagonally forward.
"Rooks" Rooks move horizontally or vertically on any number of free squares.
Knights: Knights move in an L-shaped pattern: two squares in one direction, then a perpendicular square.
"riders"  move in an L-shaped pattern: two squares in one direction, then a perpendicular square. They can jump over the other pieces.
"Bishops": Bishops move diagonally to any number of free squares.
"Queen": The queen can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally on any number of free squares.
