Welcome to My New chess game, it's my first game, so please be indulgent :=)

## How to Play

### Introduction :
Chess is a game of strategy and reflection that pits two players against each other on a board of 64 squares, alternately light and dark, called a chessboard. Each player controls an army of 16 pieces, including a king, queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means that the king is threatened with capture and cannot escape this threat.

At the start of the game, the pieces are placed in the two rows closest to each player.The arrangement is symmetrical with respect to the median axis of the chessboard.Pawns occupy each player's second row, while the other pieces occupy the first row in the order: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight and rook.
Piece movement :
- `pawn` move forward one square at a time, but may move forward two squares on their first move.They capture diagonally forward.
- **Rooks** Rooks move horizontally or vertically on any number of free squares.
- **Knights**: Knights move in an L-shaped pattern: two squares in one direction, then a perpendicular square.
- **riders**  move in an L-shaped pattern: two squares in one direction, then a perpendicular square. They can jump over the other pieces.
- **Bishops**: Bishops move diagonally to any number of free squares.
- **Queen**: The queen can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally on any number of free squares.
- **King**: The king can move one square in any direction. He is, however, restricted to checkmate.

- **Checkmate and Checkmate**:
A player puts the opponent's king in check by placing it under direct threat of capture. The player whose king is in check must protect it on his turn. If the player cannot move his king to safety, then it's checkmate, and the game is over.

### Other rules :
Castling is a special move involving the king and one of the player's rooks.
Prise en passant is a special rule that allows a pawn to be captured if it moves two squares from its initial position and is side by side with an opponent's pawn.
Pawn promotion occurs when the pawn reaches the last row of the chessboard and is replaced by another piece, usually a queen.

### End of the game 
#### The game can end in different ways:
- Checkmate.
Pat, when the player whose turn it is has no legal move to make and his king is not in check. In this case, the game ends in a draw.
- Draw by mutual agreement.
50-move rule, when 50 moves have been played by each player without any piece capture or pawn move.



## Conclusion:
Playing chess is a captivating intellectual challenge requiring strategy, patience and concentration. By mastering the basic rules and developing tactical and strategic skills, players can explore the infinite richness of this timeless game.
